## Illustrations:
In this folder, we present the results of our proposed methods applied to a real-world scenario, as illustrated in the accompanying figures.

The dataset used is the SRBCT gene expression data, which consists of 2,038 genes across 83 samples. For analysis, we compute the F-statistic for all gene expression values and select the top 100 genes as the target data for estimation.

The figures display the covariance matrix constructed from the selected 100 genes. The heatmaps shown represent the absolute values of the estimated correlations among these genes.

Figure Comparison contrasts the original data with the results obtained using various penalty functions, including SCAD, MCP, and Nuclear norm regularization.
