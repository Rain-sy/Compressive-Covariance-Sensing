## Illustrations:
In this foloder, the results of our proposed methods applied in the real-world scenario is shown in the figures.

The dataset is the SRBCT gene expression data, including 2038 genes for 83 samples.  we calculate the F-statistic of all the gene expression values, and we pick the top 100 genes as the real-data to estimate.

In the figures, the selected 100 genes data are turned in to the covariance matrix, and the heat map of the absolute values of estimated correlations are shown in the figures.

The _Comparison.figure_ illustrates the original data and the results of each penaltis, including SCAD, MCP and the Nuclear methods.
